Discussion, Non Steam Downloads and GitHub Repositories of this mod is available at: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=18995
Please Use that Thread for Discussion / Feedback that would like me to reply to. 
Ideally Bugs should be logged on GitHub although in the discussion thread is also fine.
