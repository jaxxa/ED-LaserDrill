	<description>Version: 2.2.0.0

Adds a Drilling Laser Targeting system that allows the creation or removal of steam vents. After research and construction, you will power the building while it conducts a subsurface scan. After the scan is complete, it can use a large amount of stored battery power to activate the laser of an orbiting satellite to drill or collapse a steam vent.
    
Continuation of the ED-LaserDrill by the great Jaxxa (who inspired me to become a Rimworld modder).

I ported it to RimWorld v1.3, v1.4, and v1.5.
